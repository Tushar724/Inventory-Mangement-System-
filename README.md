We have developed a Inventory management system using Python and SQl
Functionalities :- 
It stores the data entered by the user using database language MYSQL.
Python is used to create the GUI interface of the application 
We have imported libraries from the Python to integrate the gui with the database. We have used the exceptional handling methods to handle the exceptions or the errors that might occur in the program, so that the
